Chronograph is a JavaScript library for generating graph visualizations from temporal data models.  It functions by taking graph structures in one of two formats (JSON or XML) and displaying the graph on a page using SVG.  Additionally, agent traversal information can be bundled with the graph structure and then animated on the displayed graph.
