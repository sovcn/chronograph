# Introduction

Chronograph is a JavaScript library for generating graph visualizations from temporal data models.  It functions by taking graph structures in one of two formats (JSON or XML) and displaying the graph on a page using SVG.  Additionally, agent traversal information can be bundled with the graph structure and then animated on the displayed graph.

# Features

* [x] Import JSON or XML graph structures and draw using SVG package.
* [x] Package graph traversal (time-sensitive) data and bind to graph structure.
* [x] Simulate graph traversal over time using arbitrary time-steps.
* [] Simulate graph traversal using included time data.
* [] Provide external interface for interacting and maniuplating graph in real time.

# Installation
