# Introduction

ChronoGraph is a JavaScript library for generating graph visualizations from temporal data models.  It functions by taking graph structures in one of two formats (JSON or XML) and displaying the graph on a page using SVG.  Additionally, agent traversal information can be bundled with the graph structure and then animated on the displayed graph.

# Features

* [x] Import JSON or XML graph structures and draw using SVG package.
* [x] Package graph traversal (time-sensitive) data and bind to graph structure.
* [x] Simulate graph traversal over time using arbitrary time-steps.
* [ ] Simulate graph traversal using included time data.
* [ ] Provide external interface for interacting and maniuplating graph in real time.

# Installation

**Requirement**
You must install [D3] (d3js.org) in your application before running ChronoGraph

Clone a copy of ChronoGraph by running:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sovcn/chronograph.git
```

Include chronograph.js in your document:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="chronograph.js"></script>
```
